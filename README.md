# PDFgear - API Reverse Engineering

This is a GitHub project for reverse engineering the pfdgear API and creating a script to get the summary of a message. Just a quick and dirty script to get the summary of a message, not really usable yet

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository
- Install the requirements
- Edit the message (very primitive, you have to edit the code)
- Run the script

The script will make a POST request to the `https://chatapi.pdfgear.com/pdf/getsummary` endpoint with the provided message. It will then return the summary of the message.

## TODO

There are some improvements that can be made to this script:
- Add more ways to get content from a message.
- Improve error handling and parsing of the response.
- Add more endpoints to the script.
- Add more documentation to the script.
- Refactor the code to make it more readable.
